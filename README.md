# Multi-User Chat Program

[**_Multi-User Chat Program_**](https://github.com/RockingRok/ChatProgram) is a personal project which I have worked on which involved:

  - Using JavaFX to create a client side UI as well as a server UI and using Java sockets to create a back end server.
  - Utilizing an observer design pattern, in which the server acts as an observable and clients watch the server for any changes.
  - Creating private chat rooms and also saving chat history for new users.

## How It Works
  ![Two Clients and Server](https://github.com/RockingRok/ChatProgram/blob/master/screenshots/chat%20and%20server.JPG)
  - The user is able to set a unique nickname and log in.
  - The server and clients run on localhost automatically but that can be changed through parameters.

  ![Users Communicating](https://github.com/RockingRok/ChatProgram/blob/master/screenshots/chat%20two%20users.JPG)
  - Once the users have set nicknames they are able to chat within the "Main" channel.
  - This is also the starting channel for all new users.

  ![Private Chat Rooms](https://github.com/RockingRok/ChatProgram/blob/master/screenshots/three%20users.JPG)
  - They can also select other users and create a provate chat with them, which doesn't let anyone else see what they type in that channel.
  - If they switch back to other channels, that channel's chat history will automatically be pulled up for them.
